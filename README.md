# settings file format?

```yaml

```


# Quickstart

**Install pyreleaser**

```shell
sudo yum install python3
pip3 install pygithub --user
```


**Creating a project...**

## Tips and tricks

**Including non-python files in your wheel**
Including non-python files requires a bit of work so we do it all for you...

Integration points:
* `/setup.py` in `setuptools.setup()`: `include_package_data=True`
* `/MANIFEST.in` - file patterns to include
* `/yourpakage/res` - folder of files to include

Reference: https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-manifest-in/

**getting the filename of bundled files**
```python
    os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(
            os.path.realpath(__file__)
        ),
        filename
    )
```



## Troublshooting
creating projects always fails with error:

```
pipenv.vendor.requirementslib.exceptions.RequirementError: Error parsing requirement . -- are you sure it is installable?
```

I run `pipenv` manually and get the same error - nothing fixes this, what
gives?

This can be caused by an errant `Pipfile` _above_ the directory you are
working in. Try moving it out of the way

## Developing

**Run tests with coverage**

(once) pipenv install --dev
make test
